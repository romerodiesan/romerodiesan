# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Diesan Romero.

I have experience in various programming paradigms and design patterns. I use programming languages like Javascript and Python. My best skills are in backend development but open to new adventures.

I use methodologies such as Test Driven Development to improve my practices when writing code and tools such as Git to keep track of the progress in the projects I participate in.

I like to learn and not give up when facing unimaginable challenges from day to day. The code is just one of the tools I use to be able to offer solutions to problems. I like to make things happen and never stop to learn.
